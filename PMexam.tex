		\begin{itemize}
			\item[Goal] 	Generate a representatative sample
			\item[Mean]		Searching state-space for probability clusters in 2 steps
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item 	Choose $x_0$ in any way

				\item  	Given previous step $X^{[n-1]} = x^{[n-1]}$, draw proposal
					$$ Y \sim \mathcal{Q}(x^{[n-1]}, \circ) $$

				\item 	Draw
					$$ U \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1) $$	

				\item 	Accept the proposal ($X_{n} := Y$) if 
					$$ U \leq \alpha(x^{[n-1]},Y) $$
				\item[where] $\alpha (x^{[n-1]},y) = 1 \wedge \frac{\pi(y)}{\pi(x^{[n-1]})}$

	\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Problems with Metropolis-Hastings}
	    	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Choice of $\alpha$ : self-adjointess of corresponding kernel:
				$$ \mathcal{M}(x, A) = \underbrace{\int_A \alpha(x,y) \mathcal{Q}(x, \mathrm{d}\,y)}_{\prob \Big( X^{[n+1]}\not=x \,\,\text{and}\,\, X^{[n+1]} \in A \Big) } + \,
				\mathbb{I}_A(x) \underbrace{\int \Big(1- \alpha(x,y)\Big) \mathcal{Q}(x, \mathrm{d}\,y)}_{\prob \Big( X^{[n+1]} = x\Big)}$$
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Kernel preserves the distribution $\pi(x)\mathrm{d}\,x$
			\end{itemize}

			\item Problem: $\frac{\pi(y)}{\pi(x^{[n-1]})}$
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 	 promotes acceptances of points with not so much smaller probability
			\end{itemize}

			\item[If] 	$\mathcal{Q}(x,\circ)$ centered to much around $x$, 
			\item[then] Difficult to leave $x$'s surroundings.
